# TASE
Simulation model.
Simulation software: Matlab/Simulink R2024b
Simulation settings: fixed step size, 1ms step size, solver ODE3
1.	Van0: The Parameter identification model V0 includes N-PE and weak excitation intensity (by modifying the initial value of the system state). 
2.	Van1: Parameter identification model V1 is used to verify the convergence results of estimation errors under different predefined-time constants. 
3.	Van2: Parameter recognition model V2, considering noise. 
4.	Van3: The adaptive control model applies the proposed method to adaptive control and sets different initial values and unknown parameters.
